Based on your initial plan and our discussions, here's a comprehensive summary of what we've accomplished and what remains:

Progress Summary
‚úÖ Completed Items
1. Form Simplification

Reduced Generate AI Workout Plan form to 5 essential fields only
Added planType selection (independent vs progressive)
Removed complex fields like fitness level, equipment, and goals from form
Form now focuses on: duration, workouts per week, time per workout, and plan type
2. Progress Snapshot Infrastructure

Implemented two-tier progress snapshot system in database schema
Created weekly snapshot storage with AI-generated summaries
Built plan completion snapshot system for distilled insights
Added database storage methods for both snapshot types
Created API routes for snapshot creation and retrieval
3. AI Integration Foundation

Enhanced WorkoutPlanRequest interface to support planType
Implemented AI functions for creating weekly and plan completion snapshots
Added context-aware prompt preparation for progressive plans
üîÑ Partially Completed
1. Context-Aware Prompt Generation

Basic structure implemented in generateWorkoutPlan function
Progress context fetching added for progressive plans
Some import and type issues remain to be resolved
‚ùå Still To Do
1. Complete Prompt System Implementation

Fix remaining TypeScript errors in routes and OpenAI integration
Implement different prompt strategies for independent vs progressive plans
Test and refine AI prompt effectiveness with real progress data
2. GPT-4.1-nano Migration

Switch from current model to GPT-4.1-nano for faster responses
Update all OpenAI API calls to use the new model
3. Enhanced AI Coach Features

Improve coaching tip generation using progress history
Enhance chat context management with user-specific insights
Current OpenAI.ts System
How It Works Now:

Single generateWorkoutPlan function creates comprehensive workout plans
Uses token-heavy prompts with full user profile data
Generates complete plans in one API call
Limited personalization based only on current user preferences
Basic coaching tip generation without historical context
Integration with App:

Form sends simplified request to /api/generate-plan endpoint
Progress tracking system monitors generation steps
Generated plans stored in database with exercise normalization
Coach interactions use basic prompt templates
Planned Changes (Next Phase)
1. Smart Context Management:

Progressive plans will use plan completion snapshots as context
Independent plans will use fresh prompts without history
Token-efficient summaries instead of full workout data
2. Enhanced Personalization:

AI learns from user's past workout performance
Recommendations based on adherence patterns and preferences
Adaptive difficulty based on historical success rates
3. Improved Efficiency:

Faster responses with GPT-4.1-nano model
Compressed context for better token economy
Weekly snapshots for granular progress tracking
The foundation is solid - your two-tier snapshot approach and simplified form provide the infrastructure needed for intelligent, context-aware workout plan generation. The next agent can focus on completing the prompt implementation and migrating to the faster AI model.

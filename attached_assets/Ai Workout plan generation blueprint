## 2 Utility helpers (`server/utils.ts`)
```ts
export const slugify = (n:string)=> n.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g,"-").replace(/(^-|-$)/g,"");
export const upsertExercise = async (ex,prisma)=> prisma.exercise.upsert({
  where:{slug:slugify(ex.exerciseName)},
  update:{primaryMuscle:ex.primaryMuscle,secondaryMuscle:ex.secondaryMuscle,equipment:ex.equipment,movementType:ex.movementType},
  create:{slug:slugify(ex.exerciseName),name:ex.exerciseName,primaryMuscle:ex.primaryMuscle,secondaryMuscle:ex.secondaryMuscle,equipment:ex.equipment,movementType:ex.movementType}
});
````

---

## 3 OpenAI wrapper (`server/openai.ts`)

```ts
export const callOpenAI = (msgs)=> openai.chat.completions.create({
  model:"gpt-4.1-mini",stream:true,response_format:{type:"json_object"},max_tokens:8000,temperature:0.3,top_p:1,messages:msgs
});
// streaming JSON validator using Ajv compiled from LONG_JSON_SCHEMA
```

---

## 4 Generation pipeline

**SKELETON CALL**

```ts
msgs=[{role:"system",content:SYSTEM_PROMPT},{role:"assistant",content:LONG_JSON_SCHEMA},{role:"user",content:JSON.stringify({profile,prefs,request:"create skeleton only"})}];
```

• insert WorkoutPlan & PlanWeek from response.

**WEEK DETAIL LOOP** (for w=1‥durationWeeks)

```ts
msgs=[system,schema,{role:"user",content:JSON.stringify(profile)},{role:"assistant",content:JSON.stringify({planMeta:{id, title:plan.title},weeksSummary})},{role:"user",content:`{"request":"populate weekIndex":${w}}`}
]
```

• callOpenAI → upsertExercise() → insert workouts & workoutExercises.

---

## 5 Weekly progress summariser

raw sessions → small **o4-mini** call → save ProgressSnapshot (200‑300 tokens).

---

## 6 Next-plan generator

```ts
msgs=[system,schema,{role:"user",content:JSON.stringify(profile)},{role:"assistant",content:JSON.stringify({priorProgress:latestSnapshot.jsonSnapshot})},{role:"user",content:JSON.stringify({prefs:newPrefs,newGoal,request:"create full plan"})}]
```

• model "gpt-4.1-mini" (switch to "o4-mini" only if >8 K expected).

---

## 7 Token safety recap

schema≈600 + profile≈50 + snapshot≈250 + request≈30 < **1 K prompt** per‑week output ≈3–4 K ⇒ three weeks < 12 K ⇒ far inside 32 K cap.

---

## 8 Hand‑off notes for the dev

• Do **not** ask OpenAI for `videoUrl`; leave null. • A separate cron/service hits the YouTube API to fill `videoUrl` where null. • Chat / tips reuse this architecture—inject `profile` + latest `priorProgress` snapshot, never raw sessions. • Switch to week‑at‑a‑time if duration >6 to stay under 8 K tokens/call. • Use “” follow‑up if stream ends mid‑JSON.

---

### WHY THIS VERSION SUCCEEDS

• Structured variability keeps workouts fresh yet consistent. • Tiny snapshots preserve long‑term memory (<300 tokens/month). • Chunked generation avoids token overflows. • Single schema guarantees DB‑ready output. • Slug‑based upsert prevents duplicate exercises.

Current Algorithm Flow & Quota Usage
Per Exercise Search Process:

Search API calls: Up to 5 attempts per exercise (100 quota units each) = 500 units max
Video Details API calls: Up to 10 videos per search × 5 searches = 50 calls (1 quota unit each) = 50 units max
Thumbnail verification: HTTP HEAD requests (no quota cost)
Total per exercise: Up to 550 quota units (worst case)

Major Inefficiencies Identified
1. Excessive Search Attempts

Current: 5 different search variations per exercise
Each search fetches 10 videos and gets details for all of them
Most exercises find a video on the first 1-2 attempts
2. Redundant Video Detail Fetching

Fetches details for all 10 videos from each search
Only needs details for videos that pass initial filtering
Could filter by title/channel first, then get details only for promising candidates
3. No Intelligent Search Ordering

Doesn't prioritize simpler, more likely-to-succeed searches first
Complex searches with multiple terms often fail but still consume quota
Optimization Strategy for 99%+ Coverage
1. Reduce Search Attempts: 5 → 2 searches per exercise

Use only the two most effective search patterns
Save 300 quota units per exercise
2. Selective Detail Fetching:

Pre-filter videos by title keywords and preferred channels
Only fetch details for top 3 candidates instead of all 10
Save 35 quota units per exercise
3. Smarter Search Prioritization:

Start with simple "{exercise name} tutorial"
Fallback to "{exercise name} exercise" only if needed
Most exercises succeed on first attempt
4. Batch Processing with Early Termination:

Stop searching once a suitable video is found
Average quota usage would drop to ~150 units per exercise
Projected Quota Savings
Current usage: 23 exercises × 550 units = 12,650 units
Optimized usage: 23 exercises × 150 units = 3,450 units
Savings: 73% reduction in quota usage

This optimization would likely maintain 99%+ success rate while using dramatically less quota, allowing for future video searches and maintaining sustainable API usage.

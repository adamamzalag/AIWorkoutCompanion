Based on my analysis, here's a strategic plan to fix the YouTube video integration issues:

Priority-Ordered Fix Plan
Priority 1: Data Integrity Foundation
Problem: Exercise IDs in workouts don't match actual exercise names in database
Fix: Create a systematic approach to align workout exercise references with database entries
Why First: Without correct data mapping, any video fetching improvements are meaningless

Steps:

Audit all workout JSONs to identify intended vs actual exercise mappings
Either update exercise database entries to match workout intentions, or update workout JSONs to reference correct exercise IDs
Establish data validation to prevent future mismatches
 

Priority 2: Enhanced Video Search Strategy
Problem: Current search is too restrictive and uses poor search terms
Fix: Redesign search algorithm with movement-type awareness
Why Second: Once data is correct, we need smarter searching to find quality videos

Improvements:

Different search strategies for warm-up/cool-down vs main exercises
Broader search terms and multiple fallback queries
Less restrictive scoring that accepts more tutorial types
Movement pattern recognition (push, pull, squat, hinge, etc.)
 
Priority 3: API Efficiency Optimization
Problem: Wasting API calls on wrong searches and redundant requests
Fix: Implement caching and batch processing improvements
Why Third: After fixing search quality, optimize for cost and speed

Optimizations:

Cache successful searches to avoid re-searching
Batch processing with smarter rate limiting
Skip re-searching exercises that already have verified working videos
Implement video validation before database updates
 
Priority 4: Movement Type Categorization
Problem: All movements treated equally regardless of purpose
Fix: Create different video requirements for different movement types
Why Fourth: Fine-tune the system for optimal user experience

Categorizations:

Warm-up movements: prefer shorter videos (30s-2min)
Main exercises: detailed form videos (1-5min)
Cool-down/stretches: relaxing, clear instruction videos
Cardio movements: demonstration videos showing proper technique
 
Priority 5: Fallback and Error Handling
Problem: No graceful degradation when videos aren't found
Fix: Implement intelligent fallbacks and error recovery
Why Last: Polish the system after core functionality works

Improvements:

Progressive fallback search strategies
Alternative exercise suggestions when no video found
Better error logging and monitoring
User feedback mechanism for video quality
Recommended Starting Point
I suggest we start with Priority 1 - fixing the data integrity issues. This involves:

Examining the intended exercise names in workout JSONs
Checking what those exercises should actually be called
Either updating the exercise database entries or fixing the workout references
Establishing a validation system
This foundation work will make all subsequent improvements actually effective. Without correct data mapping, even the best video search algorithm will fail.

Would you like me to begin with Priority 1 and audit the data mismatches in workout ID 51, or do you prefer a different starting approach?
